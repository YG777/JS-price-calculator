a request will need to be made from a server to get the data
each item has a base price (black and white) or a base colour price (colour)
    greetings cards are the exception as they are only available in colour
    
extra prices can be added on to the base price depending on the options chosen (extra pages, duplex etc)
we need to calculate how much it will cost to send x number of items, with the options chosen by the user
it will only need to calculate one type (letter, greetingCard etc.) at a time
    
the data will look like this
{
    "a5Postcard": {
        "a5BasePrice": 40,
        "a5BasePriceColour": 50
    },
    "a6Postcard": {
        "a6BasePrice": 39,
        "a6BasePriceColour": 47
    },
    "greetingCard": {
        "basePrice": 100
    },
    "letter": {
        "basePrice": 44,
        "basePriceColour": 49,
        "extraSheet": 4,
        "extraSheetColour": 6,
        "duplexExtra": 2,
        "duplexExtraColour": 3
    }
}
